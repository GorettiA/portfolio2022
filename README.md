# My portfolio with projects from July 2021 to now

**Tech Stack Used**

HTML | CSS | Javascript
React | 

## Why I built my portfolio this way

- A responsive app styled with pure CSS with the intention of it being an on-going project. I chose not to use a CSS framework in order to grasp the basics of styling with pure CSS. It's a work in progress but you can view my projects past and present here now.

- Shout out to Jen Kramer and Frontend Masters for the ace tutorial!
