## Why I built my portfolio this way

- Kept things simple in order to get my portfolio out to recruiters asap. A basic responsive structure styled with pure CSS with the intention of adding to it later on down the track. Let's say it's a work in progress but you can view my projects past and present on here now.

## Thanks for stopping by :)
